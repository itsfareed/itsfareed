### Hi there 👋

<!--
**itsfareed/itsfareed** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

#Hi, I'm itsFareed. I guess this is a new space for me, since its mostly empty and bland and I have to fill it up. 

#This is all very new to me, and I want to use this place to update you and me on my progress with the new language. 


#- 🔭 I’m working on getting my Master's in International Affairs at Columbia University. 
#- 🌱 I’m learning everything I can about using GitHub, Git, Python, and Plateau. 
#- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on whatever gets me the knowledge I can use to succeed. 
#- 🤔 I’m looking for help with nothing at the moment. I am taking it step by step. 
#- 💬 Ask me about using meal prep kits. I have become a bit of an expert with them. But maybe I am overpaying a bit? 
#- 📫 How to reach me: just send me a message here. 
#- 😄 Pronouns: He Him
#- ⚡ Fun fact: I love reading about science fiction.
