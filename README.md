Hi, I'm itsFareed. I guess this is a new space for me, since its mostly empty and bland and I have to fill it up. 

This is all very new to me, and I want to use this place to update you and me on my progress with the new language. 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on getting my Master's in International Affairs at Columbia University. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning everything I can about using GitHub, Git, Python, and Plateau. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on whatever gets me the knowledge I can use to succeed. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with nothing at the moment. I am taking it step by step. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about using meal prep kits. I have become a bit of an expert with them. But maybe I am overpaying a bit? 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: just send me a message here. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love reading about science fiction.
